When the user opens the application, they see a screen where they can get information about the application. We thought this would be more guiding for the
user.

Users can access some information about plants, the conditions necessary for their survival, and the prices through our app by clicking on a plant.

After logging in, they can also favorite the plants they like and then view them from the favorites page. They can also add plants to their cart in a similar way. Then, they
can see the total price that they must pay to buy plants.

On the profile page, there is a section called 'My Plants'. We aimed to enable users to add their own plants and information about their plants on this page.

We created the profile page, but we didn't give it functionality except for the Logout and My Plant sections. Logout redirects the user to Sign In page and the user
can go back to the profile page from the My Plants page.
